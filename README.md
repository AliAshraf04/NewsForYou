# NewsForYou
"News For You" is a modern news website built with Next.js 14, leveraging the App Router for speed and simplicity. Key features include parallel and intercepted routes for seamless modal transitions, dynamic content with slug-based URLs, a responsive dark theme, and a focus on user experience.

**Note on File Structure:**
Please be aware that due to limitations in how GitHub renders web projects, the file structure in this repository might not precisely mirror the intended route organization as developed in VS Code. Next.js 14's App Router features like parallel routes, intercepted routes, and route groups are utilized to enhance the user experience with features like seamless modal transitions. While these features are functional within the deployed application, the underlying file organization in this repository might appear different from the logical routing structure within the Next.js project.
